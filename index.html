      Hello. My name is David. I am a third-year undergraduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in software development and games. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills and allow me to learn new things. During my free time, I like to learn and explore new technologies, play video games, and watch YouTube videos. I am always looking for opportunities to grow and improve as a developer. If you would like to know more about my work or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me through the contact page.
