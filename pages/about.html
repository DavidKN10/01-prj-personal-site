    <p>
      Hello! My name is David. I am a third-year undergraduate Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I plan on graduating in May 2026 with a Bachelor's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by technology primariy through playing video games. In high school, I thought I wanted to become an engineer. However, as I did more assignments that involved programming, I realized that coding was my calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Berwyn, Illinois, but was raised in Cicero in my early years. Me and my family moved back to Berwyn when I started Middle School and have lived here ever since. I attendended Morton West High School and graduated in 2022 Summa Cum Laude. As I mentioned before, I originally thought I wanted to become an engineer. In High School, I took all the enginerring classes that were offered. In my Junior and Senior year, when I took Principles of Engineering and Computer Integrated Manufacturing, there were several projects that involved programming. I found myself enjoying these assignments in particular and performed better than other students in my class. This was the moment I made my decision to persue a career in Computer Science.

    <p>
      Currently, I am a full time student at Illinois Institute of Techonology. So far, I have taken several CS courses and have done a good job in them. I have received Dean's List for all the years I have attendended.

      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games. Since I have not had much time to play games due to my studies, I have been playing gacha games since you can play them in short bursts and have them running in the background while I do other things. I also watch YouTube videos. I watch VTubers the most, more specifially from Hololive and have been for a long time now. In addition, I also enjoy watching videos related to technology and video games.
