    <p>
      Hello! My name is David. I am a third-year undergraduate Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I plan on graduating in May 2026 with a Bachelor's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by technology primariy through playing video games. In high school, I thought I wanted to become an engineer. However, as I did more assignments that involved programming, I realized that coding was my calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Berwyn, Illinois, but was raised in Cicero in my early years. Me and my family moved back to Berwyn when I started Middle School.
